                Hi Jess, I know there might be a lot of things on your mind, but today, I just want to take a moment to tell you how special you are to me.  There's something I've been wanting to say for a while now...

                If you ever ask why I fell for you, I'll tell you: it was inevitable.  I built walls around my heart, tried to convince myself that I could resist.  I even avoided you, thinking that absence would make the feelings fade. But like the sun rising, like the tide coming in, my heart was drawn to you.  My walls crumbled, and my heart found its way to you.

You are not just a part of my life; you are the best part, the one I choose now and always. The past is behind me, but my heart belongs to you, and that’s the only thing that truly matters.

                I find myself falling more for you.

                You don't need to change a thing.  Your flaws are not blemishes, they are the constellations that map the landscape of your soul.  They tell a story, your story, and it's a story I want to read again and again.  I'll cherish you, every star in your sky, because it's in your imperfections that I find the most breathtaking beauty.
